# Medical Camp Management system (MCMS)

### description:

This web app works to manage a medical camp. This project was worked on with both Full stack Backend and frontend . In this application, we will see a landing page with many sections. Here we can see a heading, a carousel slider, and we can see popular games and we can see feedback from the camps. There is another route in this project called Anabel Ken, which means All Ken, which can be seen in this route. Here are some search implementations . There is also a shorting that we can do. Why is there another button above the high rating and above the high star? How will that layout column be displayed? .Clicking on the Columns button will bring up the options for Column One and Two. Clicking on Column Two will display two columns, and clicking on Three will display three columns. The selection option is placed at the bottom. Clicking on Next will take you to the next page, and clicking on it will take you to the previous page. There are numbers, and the number of pages we will show on this page is given through a selection. We can see a pic avatars icon, clicking on it will bring up a dropdown menu from where we can see the dashboard, view profiles, log out, and each . When we click on the dashboard, we will go to the dashboard layout. So here there is a condition, one is the Organize account and the other is the Participant account. He can do many things only. We have analyzed the dashboard, we can see how much money has been deposited and how many camps there are and how many participants are in the application and how many have correctly feedback this campbell. The organizer can create a camp, update it, and delete it if they want. If we go to the All Participants route, we will be able to see all the participants we have. From here, if we want, the organizer can make one of them an admin and delete anything else.

### bullet points to feature your website.

- I have an Aborts icon in this route. This is where we conditionally place Aborts and Character Names.
- We can see all statuses in the Organizer dashboard.For example, how much money have I received and how many camps are there and how many participating users are there and how many camps have successfully given feedback.

- The organizer can create a camp from the add-a-camera, delete it if they want, and update it if something needs to be renamed.

- We have uploaded the image here. We have added functionality to it through the Image DB API. It is working very well.

- In the All Participants route, we have registered all participants here. Only the organizer can see them. If the organizer wants, he can admin any participant from here.

- In the Profile Manager route, we have set up how to take the information from a participant's profile and through input, the information is directly stored in the database and can be displayed on the site in a very beautiful way.

- There is a Manage Register Joining round here and if we click there we can see a lot of information that we can see if a participant is making a set payment here and we can change its status if we want.Here we have implemented a search bar so that if we want to search for something, we can bring it up.

- There are two more routes here, they are log out and one is the home page because if we want, we can log out from here and if we want, we can go to Umm as per our need.

- A user, the organizer, can see if a participant is making a payment and can change the payment status and confirmation status if he wants to, and the person who is paying can be understood by clicking the correct button.

- We will be able to see some things in the analysis, such as how many camps they have joined, how many successful payments they have made, how many pending payments they have made, and a history of how much money they have deposited in total.

- In the participant join register route, we can see how many camps he has joined and which ones are typing or unpaid, we can see the status, and we can see the pending and confirmed statuses, and if the payment has been made, we can see the feedback option.

- If we haven't paid at the restart camp, there will be a payment button, clicking on that payment button will take me to the payment road, from there we can complete the payment with a Visa card.

- We have a payment history here, where we can see a history of the money we have paid, including the transaction ID, how much money we have received, and the confirmation status and the date we deposited it.

- We have implemented authentication. We are working with React very little authentication and we have used React in the forms on the login and register pages.

- We have used as a security measure that the WT token we used will automatically log us out after an hour and the token will expire.

- We created an instant and used Axios' most powerful future is inter-sector we created through custom hooks.
